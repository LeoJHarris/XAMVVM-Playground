# Advanced Prism Tab Navigation with MVVM & Test friendly manner in Xamarin.Forms!

If you're looking for how to navigate inside a Xamarin.Forms Tab Page programatically in a MVVM friendly and Test-able manner, without having any XAML-Code-Behind garbage. Welcome to my post!

* Switch between Child-Tabs when you are,
	* Coming into the TabbedPage
	* Already in the TabbedPage
	* Coming back to the TabbedPage
* Fully MVVM compatible
* Fully Test-able, yaay!
* Binding, Commands and Interfaces FTW!
* Almost no XAML-code-behind garbage
* Coming back to the TabbedPage, the Child-Tab switching occurs only when the TabbedPage is actually visible

How cool is that eh! ðŸ˜‰
